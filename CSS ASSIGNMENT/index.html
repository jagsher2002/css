                <!-- Breathin song by Ariana Grande lyrics -->
                <p>Some days, things just take way too much of my energy</p>
                <p>I look up and the whole room's spinning</p>
                <p>You take my cares away</p>
                <p>I can so overcomplicate, people tell me to medicate</p>
                <p>Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'</p>
                <p>How do I know if this shit's fabricated?</p>
                <p>Time goes by and I can't control my mind</p>
                <p>Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time</p>
                <p>Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'</p>
                <p>And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'</p>
                <p>keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'</p>
                <p>And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'</p>
                <p>Sometimes it's hard to find, find my way up into the clouds</p>
                <p>Tune it out, they can be so loud</p>
                <p>You remind me of a time when things weren't so complicated</p>
                <p>All I need is to see your face</p>
                <p>Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'</p>
                <p>How do I know if this shit's fabricated, oh?</p>
                <p>Time goes by and I can't control my mind</p>
                <p>Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time</p>
                <p>Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'</p>
                <p>And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'</p>
                <p>Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'</p>
                <p>And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah</p>
                <p>My, my air</p>
                <p>My, my air</p>
                <p>My, my air, my air</p>
                <p>My, my air</p>
                <p>My, my air</p>
                <p>My, my air, yeah</p>
                <p>Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'</p>
                <p>And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'</p>
                <p>Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'</p>
                <p>And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah</p>
